Where possible, we like to go beyond a single ad campaign and build extensive lead and sales funnel that persistently generates domination on market.

So, we are presenting some of our Facebook ad templates that are live tested by us on most of our outstanding ad campaigns.

## Facebook ad template

We have learned a lot spending hours and money on live campaigns. With these experience, we bring you the right audience that you need to succeed. It is easy and cheap as Facebook known about what its users are looking for or would prefer to get. It knows its user base and guides your ads to target those potential users.

Here we have used 8 ads from 4 types of businesses:

1. Local / Service
2. Ecommerce / Product
3. Digital / Info Product
4. Charity / Donation

Even if your business is not listed above, you can still model your ads based on these examples.

Facebook ads have 5 parts and all of those are important because Facebook wants to integrate their ads into the natural flow of the experience, **as seamlessly as possible**. It doesn’t change the user experience at all.

We have used ads that were created for our clients. So we have blurred out some parts of the examples that my identify them and used different images where possible.

We have seen how a business can grow with the help of successful Facebook ads and we want you to be there with us. Without further ado, let's continue.

## Local / Services - Dental Clinic

This ad was part of our campaign for a dental clinic. The clinic acquire clients by offering free consultation through phone call and check up during free visiting hours.

Facebook is a social network and people are not here to see ads. So, free consultation is great way to get acquainted with people.

They are confident in their ability to convert their possible visitor into clients. This is possible due to targeted ads offer to the person in need of the service. Thus, the objective of these ads were to generate as many leads as possible.

1. Copy : Seek attention of your audience with short questions to let people know that this ad is for those who have tooth problem. You can also be location specific by including your business location, e.g. "free dental visit in West London". Once we got attention, we tell them why the should choose us by listing two benefit - "periodontal care" and "friendly dentists and staff". Despite some exceptions, this part is usually brief.
2. Image : If your business is portfolio based you can use an image of your works. But, if it is not, like this one, you can always use stock images. The image should be eye catching, relevant and preferably colorful.
3. Caption : People scroll through Facebook news feed fast, so the headline should be short and exact. This ad is offering free dental check up which is included in the headline. Service businesses will succeed in advertising with a simple free consultation on Facebook.
4. Link Detail : This is the least noticeable part in ad and if someone is reading it, they are likely interested. People care about extra detail you provide. In the ad we asked if they want free check up with best dentists. This section is also a question, the answer to which is obviously yes. This make them more likely to click on the ad.
5. Call to Action : It is best to include on if possible. Our experience has shown to produce better impact when including a call to action. If possible, it is better to use "Sign Up". There are also some other options that may fit your offer.

## Local / Service - Gym and Fitness Center

This ad was created to promote a gym. Facebook users respond well to free offers, so whenever we work with local or service business, we would orient the ads to focus on free offer. A free training period is opportunity to try out a service before spending bucks. And if the company can deliver a reliable experience with the free offer, it can convert the newcomer into regular customer.

![adDemo04](.\adDemo04.jpg)

1. Copy : As always, starting here with attention grabber. The first line starts with capitalized letter stating the offer in short. We were careful enough as too much capitalized ad is identified by Facebook as spam. Then we provide a bit more details highlighting it's location "Red Bank". We emphasis on time 28 Day indicating enough time to try out the quality of the training.
2. Image : If yours is a local business. you don't have a lot of audience. So you have to attract most of the people that live nearby. So we created different versions of ads with different images featuring activities that occurs inside your business.
3. Caption : The headline is smart to include the offer to be free and emphasizing the location RED BANK with capital letters.
4. Link Detail : The link detail simply reiterate people to click on the "Learn More" button for free training session.
5. Call to Action : We want people to visit our business location. So, we redirect them to About Us page where people can know both contact number and address as appointments are made by visit or phone call. If "Learn More" is too vague, you can use "Sign Up" or "Call Now" instead.

## Ecommerce / Product - Online Lingerie Retailer

The ad below was created for a company that sells luxury, attractive bra, panties, thong and lingerie. These colorful, bold and appealing ads seeks attention of any person. But that's not it. Their price is reasonable for the quality of product which is a major selling point. Ecommerce sales are easier during holidays than rest of the year. This ad is not holiday specific and performs throughout the year.

1. Copy : The product is very alluring, so we've used fancy and luscious description. An advantage of the product is Scarlett Silk. Lingerie are unofficial and relaxed. So, using emoji is befitting.
2. Image : For physical products we chose some high quality photos that is colorful, attractive and best describe the product. Multiple ads with different images can be used.
3. Caption : You may use the product name and its okay to do so. Though you can use fancy, luscious, emotive copy and repeat major product benefits. We make sure to keep the caption smooth and alluring.
4. Call to Action : The simplest part of commercial Facebook ads is the call to action. So, we used the **Shop Now** button

As of above, another example ad with different image is presented below.

![adU2](.\adU2.jpg)

1. Copy : It is emphasized that the products are of unique style and they are designed for anyone in size of 28 to 40 or A to G. We used emoji as a symbol of warm hospitality.
2. Image : The image features some lucrative designs the store has to offer. This helps viewers better understand how the lingerie may look on them and decide whether to buy them. As the images are stylish with varying options, the audience are charmed to try out.
3. Call to Action : To keep it visually simple and straightforward, we added a **Shop Now** button

## Ecommerce / Product - Online Lingerie Store

Unlike the previous, these ads represent an online store bringing the product upfront. These carousel ads utilize a single ad to showcase up to ten images or videos, each with its own link. This gives your audience multiple choices to interact with.

![adU3-carosaul](.\adU3-carosaul.jpg)

As standard carousel ads can display up to 10 images, if you are  starting out and have under 10 products, keep it  simple and use carousels. But if you have more than 10 unique products or 20 similar products, it's time for a different strategy. Have you ever heard of [Dynamic Product Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/dynamic-ads) or DPA in short? It is an automatic ad that retarget audience based on your analytics data. You don't need to create individual ads. You just need to create a product catalog and an ad template. DPA is smart because it utilizes pixel to find which of your products are people more interested in. Then it creates ads of those products and shows them to people. This makes advertising so easy and dynamic that once you set it up, you only need to add new products and update old product prices and availability.

For general retargeting, it is useful to have a product set that have all the products. But if you release new products each year, you might want to sell those instead even though the older products are more popular. Think about "Windows". We all know how Windows 7 was more popular than windows 8.1 and the newer Windows 10. But, Microsoft want to sell its newer product Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 365. So they advertised the newer products to the audience.

Facebook DPA can to optimized to advertising newer products. You have to create product sets of carefully organized products. Or if you have some exclusive premium products, you should create a product set of those products.

There are four main options to consider when selecting the audience:

- view all product to broad audiences
- Viewed content or added to cart but not purchased
- View different products to product viewers
- View relevant products to purchasers

DPA for broad audiences gives you the opportunity to expand your targeting. While DPA is used to retarget products, DPA for broad audiences shows products from your Facebook product catalog to people who are new  to your brand or website.

## Digital / Info Product - Mobile Video Games

This Facebook ad template was created for an app based company. The app is a video game based on android. So the target audience is anyone using android smartphone. Facebook is a very effective platform for promoting apps. We have achieved great results for a number of apps. This ad example have no news feed link description because in Facebook's app install ads, you can't add news feed link description.

1. Copy: Promoting apps on Facebook is different than advertising products or services. Game player don't expect to read long text. So the text is short. In games, people love challenging situations. That's why this ad is asking its audience if they can do better in this game and throws challenge by telling them to be up for the challenge. As expected, people would like to see the app for themselves.
2. Image: The video shows how to play the game. It also shows how average people play it. But that's not all. It also shows that it is possible to do better. Besides, it show many attractive features that can be found in the game. The beautiful UI do well on Facebook. They naturally attract people's attention, which is the primary job of any ad.
3. Headline: In most Facebook ad headlines we try to describe the product or service in a benefit rich way. However, with app install ads we've found that approach doesn't produce the best results. Apps are often difficult to describe in a couple of words. We've seen the best results from focusing on the main attraction points of the app. That's exactly what we've done before. And games are obviously casual. So adding emoji is quite natural here
4. Call to Action: You're limited with call to action button in app install campaign. The most common is to add "Install App". You can also add "Use App". Like most aspects of Facebook advertising - if you're not sure which option will produce the best results - test them both. You'll soon find the winner.
